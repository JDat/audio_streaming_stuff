Notations:
x)  subsystems
*   functions
+   completed

1) piping. multiply and route audio streams.
* create virtual sound cards (names from config file)
* remix/reroute with sox
* disable from config file
* alternative backup minimal system with alsa only system
2) streaming to icecast
* run sox & ezstram to servers
3) recording
* VAD recorder WAV
* instant recorder W64
* control from config/utils
4) mix and arcive recorded
* merge WAVs (from VAD) with failsafe from rebood and previous day detection
* compress to mp3/ogg/opus/flac
*) Notify when archive is converting (no restart)
*) gambas GUI soft for notify while archive is converting
5) logging
* log analysers
* own foder for log files ???
6) installer
* add config path to .bashrc
AGLONA_BASE=/home/jdat/aglona/streaming

* single click install script
* install crontab for reboot script as root
* regularly reconfigure reboot to find master config (do we need this?)
* install user mode systemd and services

You might be interested in using systemd's user lingering functionality. It is enabled via loginctl enable-linger USERNAME

* create necessary folders
* create new user (do we need this?)
* include gksu for run script with root privileges (do we need this?)
* must run as root (do we need this?)
* apt install additional software
* intall sox, ezstream, pulseaudio
* include pipe create script into /etc/pulse/default.pa or $userdir/.pulse/default.pa

.ifexists /home/jdat/aglona/virtual_cards.pa
.include /home/jdat/aglona/virtual_cards.pa
.endif

or simply run from terminal/script on every boot

7) maintenace and control
* control (enable/disable sytemd daemons and restart script)
+* restart script and auto reconfigure restart script
* log manager
* other configs
* gambas GUI for control/config
8) all scripts must have
* all scripts must have logging modules and configs
* all scripts must have daily log archivers on startup
Could we do it from central place instead for every script.
* fallback if no config found
* reload functionality in case of config chnges on the fly
Maybe with service restarts?

9) network
* OpenVPN
do we need this? VPN only for remote management. audio traffic goes directly icecast servers
* Reverse SSH tunel

10) do we need ping gateway?
*) stop all streams, openvpn and icecast server. check if gateway not accesable

11) tricks and pitfalls
*) disable alsa in pulseaudio default.pa for emenrgwncy alsa streamer
*) latest ezstream have different XML config, not compatible with pevious versions
*) loginctrl to enable user systemd services
*) storage can be on other machine instead of local storage

used tools:
sox
ezstream
pulseaudio
icecast server?
awk
sed
ip route
ping
curl
systemd
bash
which (in bash???)
realpath (in bash??) (maybe useless. see path test script)
ices (maybe)
nice
openvpn?
gambas (all packages)
teamviewer???
realVNC?
